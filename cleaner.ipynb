      "7 1 What is physics?.\n",
      "8  Humans have always been curious about the world around them.\n",
      "9  The night sky with its bright celestial objects has fascinated humans since time immemorial.\n",
      "10  The regular repetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons, the eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always been a source of wonder.\n",
      "11  The world has an astonishing variety of materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behaviour.\n",
      "12   The inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded to the wonder and awe of nature in different ways.\n",
      "13  One kind of response from the earliest times has been to observe the physical environment carefully, look for any meaningful patterns and relations in natural phenomena, and build and use new tools to interact with nature.\n",
      "14   This human endeavour led, in course of time, to modern science and technology.\n",
      "15  The word Science originates from the Latin verb Scientia meaning to know.\n",
      "16   The Sanskrit word Vijnan and the Arabic word Ilm convey similar meaning, namely knowledge.\n",
      "17  Science, in a broad sense, is as old as human species.\n",
      "18  The early civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia and many others made vital contributions to its progress.\n",
      "19  From the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made in science in Europe.\n",
      "20  By the middle of the twentieth century, science had become a truly international enterprise, with many cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.\n",
      "21  What is Science and what is the so-called Scientific Method?.\n",
      "22   Science is a systematic attempt to understand natural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible, and use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and control phenomena.\n",
      "23  Science is exploring, experimenting and predicting from what we see around us.\n",
      "24  The curiosity to learn about the world, unravelling the secrets of nature is the first step towards the discovery of science.\n",
      "25  The scientific method involves several interconnected steps : Systematic observations, controlled experiments, qualitative and quantitative reasoning, mathematical modelling, prediction and verification or falsification of theories.\n",
      "26  Speculation and conjecture also have a place in science; but ultimately, a scientific theory, to be acceptable, must be verified by relevant observations  or experiments.\n",
      "27  There is much philosophical debate about the nature and method of science  that we need not discuss here.\n",
      "28 ?.\n",
      "29  The interplay of theory and observation (or experiment) is basic to the progress of science.\n",
      "30   Science is ever dynamic.\n",
      "31  There is no final theory in science and no unquestioned authority among scientists.\n",
      "32   As observations improve in detail and precision or experiments yield new results, theories must account for them, if necessary, by introducing modifications.\n",
      "33   Sometimes the modifications may not be drastic and may lie within the framework of existing theory.\n",
      "34   For example, when Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) examined the extensive data on planetary motion collected by Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), the planetary circular orbits in heliocentric  theory (sun at the centre of the solar system) imagined by Nicolas Copernicus (14731543) had to be replaced by elliptical orbits to fit the data better.\n",
      "35   Occasionally, however, the  existing theory is simply unable to explain new observations.\n",
      "36   This causes a major upheaval in science.\n",
      "37  In the beginning of the twentieth century, it was realised that Newtonian mechanics, till then a very successful theory, could not explain some of the most basic features of atomic phenomena.\n",
      "38   Similarly, the then accepted wave picture of light failed to explain the photoelectric effect properly.\n",
      "39  This led to the development of a  radically new theory (Quantum Mechanics) to deal with atomic and molecular phenomena.\n",
      "40  Just as a new experiment may suggest an alternative theoretical model, a theoretical advance may suggest what to look for in some experiments.\n",
      "41   The result of experiment of scattering of alpha particles by gold foil, in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford (18711937) established the nuclear model of the atom, which then became the basis of the quantum theory of hydrogen atom given in 1913 by Niels Bohr (18851962).\n",
      "42  On the other hand, the concept of antiparticle was first introduced theoretically by Paul Dirac (19021984) in 1930 and confirmed two years later by the experimental discovery of positron (antielectron) by Carl Anderson.\n",
      "43   Physics is a basic discipline in the category of Natural Sciences, which also includes other disciplines like Chemistry and Biology.\n",
      "44  The word Physics comes from a Greek word meaning nature.\n",
      "45  Its Sanskrit equivalent is Bhautiki that is used to refer to the study of the physical world.\n",
      "46   A precise definition of this discipline is neither possible nor necessary.\n",
      "47   We can broadly describe physics as a study of the basic laws of  nature and their manifestation in different natural phenomena.\n",
      "48   The scope of physics is described briefly in the next section.\n",
      "49   Here we remark on two principal thrusts in physics :  unification and reduction.\n",
      "50  In Physics, we attempt to explain diverse physical phenomena in terms of a few concepts and laws.\n",
      "51   The effort is to see the physical world as manifestation of some universal laws in different domains and conditions.\n",
      "52   For example, the same law of gravitation (given by Newton) describes the fall of an apple to the ground, the motion of the moon around the earth and the motion of planets around the sun.\n",
      "53  Similarly, the basic laws of electromagnetism (Maxwells equations) govern all electric and magnetic phenomena.\n",
      "54  The attempts to unify fundamental forces of nature (section 1.\n",
      "55 4) reflect this same quest for unification.\n",
      "56  A related effort is to derive the properties of a bigger, more complex, system from the properties and interactions of its constituent simpler parts.\n",
      "57  This approach is called reductionism and is at the heart of physics.\n",
      "58   For example, the subject of thermodynamics, developed in the nineteenth century, deals with bulk systems in terms of macroscopic quantities such as temperature, internal energy, entropy, etc.\n",
      "59   Subsequently, the subjects of kinetic theory and statistical mechanics interpreted these quantities in terms of the properties of the molecular constituents  of the bulk system.\n",
      "60   In particular, the  temperature was seen to be related to the average kinetic energy of molecules  of the system.\n",
      "61  1.\n",
      "62 2  Scope and excitement of physics We can get some idea of the scope of physics by looking at its various sub-disciplines.\n",
      "63   Basically, there are two domains of interest : macroscopic and microscopic.\n",
      "64  The macroscopic domain includes phenomena at the laboratory, terrestrial and astronomical scales.\n",
      "65  The microscopic domain includes atomic, molecular and nuclear phenomena*.\n",
      "66  Classical Physics deals mainly with macroscopic phenomena and includes subjects like Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Optics and Thermodynamics.\n",
      "67  Mechanics founded on Newtons laws of motion and the law of gravitation is concerned with the motion (or equilibrium) of particles, rigid and deformable bodies, and general systems of particles.\n",
      "68   The propulsion of a rocket by a jet of ejecting gases, propagation of water waves or sound waves in air, the equilibrium of a bent rod under a load, etc.\n",
      "69 , are problems of mechanics.\n",
      "70   Electrodynamics deals with electric and magnetic phenomena associated with charged and magnetic bodies.\n",
      "71  Its basic laws were given by Coulomb, Oersted, Ampere and Faraday, and encapsulated by Maxwell in his famous set of equations.\n",
      "72  The motion of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field, the response of a circuit to an ac voltage (signal), the working of an antenna, the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere, etc.\n",
      "73 , are problems of electrodynamics.\n",
      "74  Optics deals with the phenomena involving light.\n",
      "75  The working of telescopes and microscopes, colours exhibited by thin films, etc.\n",
      "76 , are topics in optics.\n",
      "77  Thermodynamics, in contrast to mechanics, does not deal with the motion of bodies as a whole.\n",
      "78  Rather, it deals with systems in macroscopic equilibrium and is concerned with changes in internal energy, temperature, entropy, etc.\n",
      "79 , of the system through external work and transfer of heat.\n",
      "80   The efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators, the direction of a physical or chemical process, etc.\n",
      "81 , are problems of interest in thermodynamics.\n",
      "82  The microscopic domain of physics deals  with the constitution and structure of matter at the minute scales of atoms and nuclei (and even lower scales of length) and their interaction with different probes such as electrons, photons and other elementary particles.\n",
      "83  Classical physics is inadequate to handle this domain and Quantum Theory is currently accepted as the proper framework for explaining microscopic phenomena.\n",
      "84   Overall, the edifice of physics is beautiful and imposing and you will appreciate it more as you pursue the subject.\n",
      "85  Fig.\n",
      "86  1.\n",
      "87 1  Theory and experiment go hand in hand in physics and help each others progress.\n",
      "88  The alpha scattering experiments of Rutherford gave the nuclear model of the atom.\n",
      "89  You can now see that the scope of physics is truly vast.\n",
      "90   It covers a tremendous range of magnitude of physical quantities like length, mass, time, energy, etc.\n",
      "91   At one end, it studies phenomena at the very small scale of length (10-14 m or even less) involving electrons, protons, etc.\n",
      "92 ; at the other end, it deals with astronomical phenomena at the scale of galaxies or even the entire universe whose extent is of the order of 1026 m.\n",
      "93   The two length scales differ by a factor of 1040 or even more.\n",
      "94   The range of time scales can be obtained by dividing the length scales by the speed of light : 1022 s to 1018 s.\n",
      "95   The range of masses goes from, say, 1030 kg  (mass of an electron) to 1055 kg (mass of known observable universe).\n",
      "96  Terrestrial phenomena lie somewhere in the middle of this range.\n",
      "97  *  Recently, the domain intermediate between the macroscopic and the microscopic (the so-called mesoscopic physics), dealing with a few tens or hundreds of atoms, has emerged as an exciting  field of  research.\n",
      "98  Hypothesis, axioms and models One should not think that everything can be proved with physics and mathematics.\n",
      "99  All physics, and also mathematics, is based on assumptions, each of which is variously called a hypothesis or axiom or postulate, etc.\n",
      "100  For example, the universal law of gravitation proposed by Newton is an assumption or hypothesis, which he proposed out of his ingenuity.\n",
      "101  Before him, there were several observations, experiments and data, on the motion of planets around the sun, motion of the moon around the earth, pendulums, bodies falling towards the earth etc.\n",
      "102  Each of these required a separate explanation, which was more or less qualitative.\n",
      "103  What the universal law of gravitation says is that, if we assume that any two bodies in the universe attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, then we can explain all these observations in one stroke.\n",
      "104  It not only explains these phenomena, it also allows us to predict the results of future experiments.\n",
      "105  A hypothesis is a supposition without assuming that it is true.\n",
      "106  It would not be fair to ask anybody to prove the universal law of gravitation, because it cannot be proved.\n",
      "107  It can be verified and substantiated by experiments and observations.\n",
      "108  An axiom is a self-evident truth while a model is a theory proposed to explain observed phenomena.\n",
      "109  But you need not worry at this stage about the nuances in using these words.\n",
      "110  For example, next year you will learn about Bohrs model of hydrogen atom, in which Bohr assumed that an electron in the hydrogen atom follows certain rules (postutates).\n",
      "111  Why did he do that?.\n",
      "112  There was a large amount of spectroscopic data before him which no other theory could explain.\n",
      "113  So Bohr said that if we assume that an atom behaves in such a manner, we can explain all these things at once.\n",
      "114 ?.\n",
      "115  Einsteins special theory of relativity is also based on two postulates, the constancy of the speed of electromagnetic radiation and the validity of physical laws in all inertial frame of reference.\n",
      "116  It would not be wise to ask somebody to prove that the speed of light in vacuum is constant, independent of the source or observer.\n",
      "117  In mathematics too, we need axioms and hypotheses at every stage.\n",
      "118  Euclids statement that parallel lines never meet, is a hypothesis.\n",
      "119  This means that if we assume this statement, we can explain several properties of straight lines and two or three dimensional figures made out of them.\n",
      "120  But if you dont assume it, you are free to use a different axiom and get a new geometry, as has indeed happened in the past few centuries and decades.\n",
      "121  Physics is exciting in many ways.\n",
      "122  To some people the excitement comes from the elegance and universality of its basic theories, from the fact that a few basic concepts and laws can explain phenomena covering a large range of magnitude of physical quantities.\n",
      "123  To some others, the challenge in carrying out imaginative new experiments to unlock the secrets of nature, to verify or refute theories, is thrilling.\n",
      "124  Applied physics is equally demanding.\n",
      "125  Application and exploitation of physical laws to make useful devices is the most interesting and exciting part and requires great ingenuity and persistence of effort.\n",
      "126  What lies behind the phenomenal progress of physics in the last few centuries?.\n",
      "127  Great progress usually accompanies changes in our basic perceptions.\n",
      "128   First, it was realised that for scientific progress, only qualitative thinking, though no doubt important, is not enough.\n",
      "129    Quantitative measurement is central to the growth of science, especially physics, because the laws of nature happen to be expressible in precise mathematical equations.\n",
      "130  The second most important insight was that the basic laws of physics are universal  the same laws apply in widely different contexts.\n",
      "131  Lastly, the strategy of approximation turned out to be very successful.\n",
      "132   Most observed phenomena in daily life are rather complicated manifestations of the basic laws.\n",
      "133  Scientists recognised the importance of extracting the essential features of a phenomenon from its less significant aspects.\n",
      "134   It is not practical to take into account all the complexities of a phenomenon in one go.\n",
      "135   A good strategy is to focus first on the essential features, discover the basic principles and then introduce corrections to build a more refined theory of the phenomenon.\n",
      "136  For example, a stone and a feather dropped from the same height do not reach the ground at the same time.\n",
      "137  The reason is that the essential aspect of the phenomenon, namely free fall under gravity, is complicated by the presence of air resistance.\n",
      "138  To get the law of free fall under gravity, it is better to create a situation wherein the air resistance is negligible.\n",
      "139  We can, for example, let the stone and the feather fall through a long evacuated tube.\n",
      "140  In that case, the two objects will fall almost at the same rate, giving the basic law that acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object.\n",
      "141   With the basic law thus found, we can go back to the feather, introduce corrections due to air resistance, modify the existing theory and try to build a more realistic theory of objects falling to the earth under gravity.\n",
      "142 ?.\n",
      "143  1.\n",
      "144 3  Physics, technology and society The connection between physics, technology and society can be seen in many examples.\n",
      "145  The discipline of thermodynamics arose from the need to understand and improve the working of heat engines.\n",
      "146   The steam engine, as we know, is inseparable from the Industrial Revolution in England in the eighteenth century, which had great impact on the course of human civilisation.\n",
      "147  Sometimes technology gives rise to new physics; at other times physics generates new technology.\n",
      "148  An example of the latter is the wireless communication technology that followed the discovery of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism in the nineteenth century.\n",
      "149  The applications of  physics are not always easy to foresee.\n",
      "150  As late as 1933, the great physicist Ernest Rutherford had dismissed the possibility of tapping energy from atoms.\n",
      "151  But only a few years later, in 1938, Hahn and Meitner discovered the phenomenon of neutron-induced fission of uranium, which would serve as the basis of nuclear power reactors and nuclear weapons.\n",
      "152  Yet another important example of physics giving rise to technology is the silicon chip that triggered  the computer revolution in the last three decades of the twentieth century.\n",
      "153  A most significant area to which physics has and will contribute is the development of alternative energy resources.\n",
      "154   The fossil fuels of the planet are dwindling fast and there is an urgent need to discover new and affordable sources of energy.\n",
      "155   Considerable progress has already been made in this direction (for example, in conversion of solar energy, geothermal energy, etc.\n",
      "156 , into electricity), but much more is still to be accomplished.\n",
      "157  Table1.!\n",
      "158 1 lists some of the great physicists, their major contribution and the country of origin.!\n",
      "159  You will appreciate from this table the multi-cultural, international character of the scientific endeavour.!\n",
      "160  Table 1.!\n",

      "163  We urge you to try to add many names and items to these tables with the help of your teachers, good books and websites on science.!\n",

      "168  Table 1.\n",
      "169 1 Some physicists from different countries of the world and their major contributions Physics is the study of nature and natural phenomena.\n",
      "170  Physicists try to discover the rules that are operating in nature, on the basis of observations, experimentation and analysis.\n",
      "171  Physics deals with certain basic rules/laws governing the natural world.\n",
      "172  What is the nature of physical laws?.\n",
      "173  We shall now discuss the nature of fundamental forces and the laws that govern the diverse phenomena of the physical world.\n",
      "174 ?.\n",
      "175  1.\n",
      "176 4  Fundamental forces in nature* We all have an intuitive notion of force.\n",
      "177  In our experience, force is needed to push, carry or throw objects, deform or break them.\n",
      "178   We also experience the impact of forces on us, like when a moving object hits us or we are in a merry-go-round.\n",
      "179  Going from this intuitive notion to the proper scientific concept of force is not a trivial matter.\n",
      "180  Early thinkers like Aristotle had wrong ideas about it.\n",
      "181   The correct notion of force was arrived at by Isaac Newton in his famous laws of motion.\n",
      "182  He also gave an explicit form for the force for gravitational attraction between two bodies.\n",
      "183  We shall learn these matters in subsequent chapters.\n",
      "184  *  Sections 1.\n",
      "185 4 and 1.\n",
      "186 5 contain several ideas that you may not grasp fully in your first reading.\n",
      "187  However, we advise you to read them carefully to develop a feel for some basic aspects of  physics.\n",
      "188  These are some of the areas which continue to occupy the physicists today.\n",
      "189  In the macroscopic world, besides the gravitational force, we encounter several kinds of forces: muscular force, contact forces between bodies, friction (which is also a contact force parallel to the surfaces in contact), the forces exerted by compressed or elongated springs and taut strings and ropes (tension), the force of buoyancy and viscous force when solids are in contact with fluids, the force due to pressure of a fluid, the force due to surface tension of a liquid, and so on.\n",
      "190  There are also forces involving charged and magnetic bodies.\n",
      "191  In the microscopic domain again, we have electric and magnetic forces, nuclear forces involving protons and neutrons, interatomic and intermolecular forces, etc.\n",
      "192   We shall get familiar with some of these forces in later parts of this course.\n",
      "193  Table 1.\n",
      "194 2  Link between technology and physics A great insight of the twentieth century physics is that these different forces occurring  in different contexts actually arise from only a small number of fundamental forces in nature.\n",
      "195   For example, the elastic spring force arises due to the net attraction/repulsion between the neighbouring atoms of the spring when the spring is elongated/compressed.\n",
      "196  This net attraction/repulsion can be traced to the (unbalanced) sum of electric forces between the charged constituents of the atoms.\n",
      "197   In principle, this means that the laws for derived forces (such as spring force, friction) are not independent of the laws of fundamental forces in nature.\n",
      "198  The  origin of these derived forces is, however, very complex.\n",
      "199   At the present stage of our understanding, we know of four fundamental forces in nature, which are described in brief here : Albert Einstein (1879-1955) Albert Einstein, born in Ulm, Germany in 1879, is universally regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time.\n",
      "200  His astonishing scientific career began with the publication of three path-breaking papers in 1905.\n",
      "201  In the first paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons) and used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect that the classical wave theory of radiation could not account for.\n",
      "202  In the second paper, he developed a theory of Brownian motion that was confirmed experimentally a few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of matter.\n",
      "203  The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity that made Einstein a legend in his own life time.\n",
      "204  In the next decade, he explored the consequences of his new theory which included, among other things, the mass-energy equivalence enshrined in his famous equation E = mc2.\n",
      "205  He also created the general version of relativity (The General Theory of Relativity), which is the modern theory of gravitation.\n",
      "206  Some of Einsteins most significant later contributions are: the notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Plancks blackbody radiation law, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of massive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics.\n",
      "207  The year 2005 was declared as International Year of Physics, in recognition of Einsteins monumental contribution to physics, in year 1905, describing revolutionary scientific ideas that have since influenced all of modern physics.\n",

      "210 1Gravitational Force The gravitational force is the force of mutual attraction between any two objects by virtue of their masses.\n",
      "211  It is a universal force.\n",
      "212  Every object experiences this force due to every other object in the universe.\n",
      "213  All objects on the earth, for example, experience the force of gravity due to the earth.\n",
      "214  In particular, gravity governs the motion of the moon and artificial satellites around the earth, motion of the earth and planets around the sun, and, of course, the motion of bodies falling to the earth.\n",
      "215   It plays a key role in the large-scale phenomena of the universe, such as formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and galactic clusters.\n",
      "216  1.\n",
      "217 4.\n",
      "218 2 Electromagnetic Force Electromagnetic force is the force between charged particles.\n",
      "219   In the simpler case when charges are at rest, the force is given by Coulombs law : attractive for unlike charges and repulsive for like charges.\n",
      "220  Charges in motion produce magnetic effects and a magnetic field gives rise to a force on a moving charge.\n",
      "221  Electric and magnetic effects are, in general, inseparable  hence the name electromagnetic force.\n",
      "222  Like the gravitational force, electromagnetic force acts over large distances and does not need any intervening medium.\n",
      "223  It is enormously strong compared to gravity.\n",
      "224  The electric force between two protons, for example, is 1036 times the gravitational force between them, for any fixed distance.\n",
      "225  Matter, as we know, consists of elementary charged constituents like electrons and protons.\n",
      "226  Since the electromagnetic force is so much stronger than the gravitational force, it dominates all phenomena at atomic and molecular scales.\n",
      "227   (The other two forces, as we shall see, operate only at nuclear scales.\n",
      "228 )  Thus it is mainly the electromagnetic force that governs the structure of atoms and molecules, the dynamics of  chemical reactions and the mechanical, thermal and other properties of materials.\n",
      "229   It underlies the macroscopic forces like  tension, friction, normal force, spring force, etc.\n",
      "230   Gravity is always attractive, while electromagnetic force can be attractive or repulsive.\n",
      "231   Another way of putting it is that mass comes only in one variety (there is no negative mass), but charge comes in two varieties : positive and negative charge.\n",
      "232  This is what makes all the difference.\n",
      "233   Matter is mostly electrically neutral (net charge is zero).\n",
      "234  Thus, electric force is largely zero and gravitational force dominates terrestrial phenomena.\n",
      "235  Electric force manifests itself in atmosphere where the atoms are ionised and that leads to lightning.\n",
      "236  Satyendranath Bose (1894-1974) Satyendranath Bose, born in Calcutta in 1894, is among the great Indian physicists who made a fundamental contribution to the advance of science in the twentieth century.\n",
      "237  An outstanding student throughout, Bose started his career in 1916 as a lecturer in physics in Calcutta University; five years later he joined Dacca University.\n",
      "238  Here in 1924, in a brilliant flash of insight, Bose gave a new derivation of Plancks law, treating radiation as a gas of photons and employing new statistical methods of counting of photon states.\n",
      "239  He wrote a short paper on the subject and sent it to Einstein who immediately recognised its great significance, translated it in German and forwarded it for publication.\n",
      "240  Einstein then applied the same method to a gas of molecules.\n",
      "241  The key new conceptual ingredient in Boses work was that the particles were regarded as indistinguishable, a radical departure from the assumption that underlies the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.\n",
      "242  It was soon realised that the new Bose-Einstein statistics was applicable to particles with integers spins, and a new quantum statistics (Fermi-Dirac statistics) was needed for particles with half integers spins satisfying Paulis exclusion principle.\n",
      "243  Particles with integers spins are now known as bosons in honour of Bose.\n",
      "244  An important consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics is that a gas of molecules below a certain temperature will undergo a phase transition to a state where a large fraction of atoms populate the same lowest energy state.\n",
      "245  Some seventy years were to pass before the pioneering ideas of Bose, developed further by Einstein, were dramatically confirmed in the observation of a new state of matter in a dilute gas of ultra cold alkali atoms - the Bose-Eintein condensate.\n",
      "246  If we reflect a little, the enormous strength of the electromagnetic force compared to gravity is evident in our daily life.!\n",
      "247   When we hold a book in our hand, we are balancing the gravitational force on the book due to the huge mass of the earth by the normal force provided by our hand.!\n",
      "248   The latter is nothing but the net electromagnetic force between the charged constituents of our hand and the book, at the surface in contact.!\n",
      "249  If electromagnetic force were not intrinsically so much stronger than gravity, the hand of the strongest man would crumble under the weight of a feather !\n",

      "254 3  Strong Nuclear Force The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons in a nucleus.\n",
      "255  It is evident that without some attractive force, a nucleus will be unstable due to the electric repulsion between its protons.\n",
      "256  This attractive force cannot be gravitational since force of gravity is negligible compared to the electric force.\n",
      "257  A new basic force must, therefore, be  invoked.\n",
      "258  The strong nuclear force  is  the strongest of all fundamental forces, about 100 times the electromagnetic force in strength.\n",
      "259   It is charge-independent and acts equally between a proton and a proton, a neutron and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron.\n",
      "260  Its range is, however, extremely small, of about nuclear dimensions (1015m).\n",

      "268   The weak nuclear force is not as weak as the gravitational force, but much weaker than the strong nuclear and electromagnetic forces.\n",
